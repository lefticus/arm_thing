# cpp_box

It implements a partial ARMv4 architecture in software.

For code this can accept, use gcc or clang in `-march=armv4` mode. Almost all builds of clang but default support `--target=armv4-linux` regardless of your host platform.

## Architecture Documentation

For more information on the ARMv4 architecture, look for documentation on the ARM7 core.

 * We are not currently attempting to support Thumb mode
 * Only supporting little endian is supported
 * For details on the implementation we are aiming for, look at the ARM7TDMI manual
    * http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0210c/index.html
    * http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0210c/DDI0210B.pdf See 1-12 for instruction format

We plan to implement the VFP version 1 for a hardware FPU. For this support add `-mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=hard` to your build command line.

For more information, look at the ARMv5 Architecture Reference Manual.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To compile the code, it requires at least C++17 to work. This includes std::filesystem which is not until GCC 8.

In this project Conan is used for package management. Conan is a portable package manager for C/C++ libraries.
It is used to cache all the dependencies needed to build into local directories, without needing to install system packages.

For installation methods of Conan, visit this [link](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html). The step-by-step instructions to enable you to build with conan is provided in Conan's website. But in case you would like to see a live demo you can check out [this video](https://youtu.be/9cCQHJ-cNHY).

To build the project with conan, you will also need to have CMake with minimum version of 3.8 to support `cxx_std_17`.

### Building
To set the compiler and the compiler version in Conan, edit the `~/.conan/profiles/default` file if necessary.

Then in the project directory:

```
mkdir build && cd build
```

Conan support is built into the CMakeLists.txt file. You must have conan installed already and need to add appropriate remote:

```
conan remote add bincrafters https://api.bintray.com/conan/bincrafters/public-conan
```


```
cmake ..
```

If cmake cannot find the version of conan you have installed you can tell it where to find it with:

```
cmake .. -DCONAN_CMD:PATH=/path/to/conan
```

## Running the tests

After successfully finishing build process, run test to see if everything is work.

You can use ctest

```
$ ctest
```

Or make

```
$ make test
```

Or execute the tests directly. To do so, simply go to `build/bin` folder and run the tests.


```
$ ./constexpr_tests
All tests passed (47 assertions in 21 test cases)
```

```
$ ./relaxed_constexpr_tests
All tests passed (47 assertions in 21 test cases)
```

## Built With

* [Conan](https://conan.io/) - The C/C++ Package Manager
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) - Cross-platform build system
* [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - The GNU Compiler Collection
